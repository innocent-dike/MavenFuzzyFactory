Analyzing-MavenFuzzyFactory-E-commerce-Data-with-MySQL
This project was done based on the Mavenfuzzyfactory E-commerce data built by Maven Analytics where I executed SQL queries of different metrics related to traffic source, conversion rates, revenue & margin, channel portfolio, and many more metrics to analyse the business traffic and website performance.
I answered the questions such as: • Find the quarterly figures since the lunch of a new product, for sessions-to-order conversion rate, revenue per order and revenue per session. • Show the quarterly view of orders from Gsearch nonbrand, Bsearch nonbrand, brand search overall, organic search and direct type-in. 
Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like? • Pull sales data of the new primary product and see how well each product cross-sells from one another.
Finally, I gave some insights that can improve the business as a whole.
